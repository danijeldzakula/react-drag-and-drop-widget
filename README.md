# React & Vite - Drag and Drop Widget

This React.js application, written in TypeScript, uses React Context for state management and data persistence. It allows users to create, update, delete, and drag-and-drop individual widgets within the interface. Each widget can be rearranged freely using drag-and-drop functionality, with their positions and states stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the layout remains intact even after a page refresh. By leveraging React Context, the application efficiently manages global state, providing a user-friendly interface for seamless and persistent widget management, including the ability to add, remove, and reorder widgets.

## 📡 Tech Stack:

- [React.js](https://react.dev/) The library for web and native user interfaces. React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.

- [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/) In traditional websites, the browser requests a document from a web server, downloads and evaluates CSS and JavaScript assets, and renders the HTML sent from the server. When the user clicks a link, it starts the process all over again for a new page.

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

- [React Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify/) React-Toastify allows you to add notifications to your app with ease. No more nonsense!

- [React DND](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about8) React DnD is unlike most of the drag and drop libraries out there, and it can be intimidating if you've never used it before. However, once you get a taste of a few concepts at the heart of its design, it starts to make sense. I suggest you read about these concepts before the rest of the docs.
